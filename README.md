This is my first project I built. A small factor analysis project which allows you to choose which factors you'd like to test, insert an index and see a datagrid breakdown and visual by industry count of the top indsutries selected
I used bql , a query language from bloomberg to extract the data, ipywidgets for the widgets, and plotly for the visuals
